# GoodWegmansHunting
ConUHacks

This is a small program that helps you search for a desired stop while on route to your destination. The main page is GitGrubFrontPage, which accepts a desired stop (e.g. wegmans, tim hortans, etc) and a distance in meters from which you are willing to deviate from your journey. This app will coninually update along your journey until it finds your desired stop.
